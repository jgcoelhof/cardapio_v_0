<p>This project was developed through the Laboratory of Applied Research in Automation Development - LAPADA, in partnership with the Iracema Institute for Research and Innovation. The laboratory coordinator conceived the idea, collaborated with the design team at the Iracema Institute, and provided screen prototypes to us, the developers at LAPADA. Through teamwork, sprint review meetings, and a significant learning process, we are now concluding this app, which can assist establishments in managing their tables and enable individuals to receive optimal service.</p>
